# Clustering‑App
*Interactive Streamlit KMeans Clustering Application*

---

## 🧠 Project Name
**Clustering‑App** – *Interactive Streamlit KMeans Clustering Application*

---

## 📌 Project Idea
This is an **interactive web application built with Python and Streamlit** that allows users to:  
- Explore datasets  
- Visualize data  
- Apply **K-Means Clustering**  
- Display clustering results in an easy-to-understand, visual way  

It helps users **identify patterns or similar groups** in their data efficiently.

## 🛠️ Key Features
✔️ Interactive UI with **Streamlit**  
✔️ Upload Excel or CSV files  
✔️ Apply **K-Means Clustering** on uploaded data  
✔️ Visualize clustering results with plots and charts  
✔️ Explore relationships between data variables  
✔️ Useful for customer segmentation or general data analysis  

---

## 📁 Project Components
🔹 **app.py** – Main Streamlit application script  
🔹 **customers.xlsx** – Sample dataset  
🔹 **notebook.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook for testing and experimentation  
🔹 **requirements.txt** – Python dependencies needed to run the project  
🔹 **.devcontainer** – Optional development environment setup  


Upload an Excel or CSV file in the interface and explore your data and clustering results.
